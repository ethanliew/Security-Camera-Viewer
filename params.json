Desigened to allow live viewing, recorded video, and motion alerts. Other cameras may work but are untested.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n+ You first need a working Logitech Alert setup (other cameras currently unsupported)\r\n  + Send motion alerts to a dedicated email address which the poller will check\r\n\r\n+ Install prerequisites as needed\r\n  + ```apt-get install ffmpeg vlc apache2 mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql php5 libapache2-mod-php5``` \r\n  + Depending on your distribution you might have to add multimedia sources to apt or package distribution system\r\n\r\n+ Download the files\r\n  + ```git clone https://github.com/salbahra/Security-Camera-Viewer.git```\r\n  + ```mv camera-viewer/cameras /var/```\r\n  + ```mv camera-viewer/www/cameras /var/www/```\r\n  + ```mv camera-viewer/VLC-init /etc/init.d/```\r\n\r\n+ Fill in the MySQL information, Email information, and site information in config.php.\r\n  + ```nano /var/www/cameras/config.php```\r\n\r\n+ Modify the feeds.vlm to transcode your videos and auto start VLC\r\n  + ```nano /var/cameras/feeds.vlm```\r\n  + ```update-rc.d vlc defaults```\r\n  + ```/etc/init.d/vlc start```\r\n\r\n+ Add the poller to crontab every 5 minutes to ensure your database is up to date with new video clips and motion alerts:\r\n  + ```*/5 * * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/www/cameras/poller.php >/dev/null 2>&1```\r\n\r\n+ Add a user to the configuration. There is no user management system yet, so this is done manually\r\n  + First generate a hased version of your password\r\n  + ```/usr/bin/php -r \"echo base64_encode(sha1('PASSWORD'));\"```\r\n  + Then add it to the htpasswd file\r\n  + ```nano /var/cameras/htpasswd```\r\n  + Example:\r\n  + ```username:ZGM3MjRhZjE4ZmJkZDRlNTkxODlmNWZlNzY4YTVmODMxMTUyNzA1MA==```\r\n\r\n+ From there you may attempt to access the front end.","google":"UA-40111352-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
